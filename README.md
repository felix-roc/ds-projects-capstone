# Deployment of the model to Heroku

In this branch you can find the container that is used to deploy the model to Heroku. The API is running at https://hdd-predicitve-maintenance-api.herokuapp.com.

## Local testing

Run `main.py` to start a local instance of the model and the API. Make sure to install the requirements.
